JSON Library Implementation in C with Support Libraries in Assembly Language

by Jerry McIntosh

---

## TO START

---

This repository is written for a Linux OS.  FYI, the JSON Library was created on an OpenSuse Linux distro.  I do all my development on OpenSuse.  To get started you will need to run the following command at the command line while in the `JSON-main` folder:

sh ./json_make.sh

Should all end well then go to the folder `json_test` to run the test script `go_json_test.sh`.

---

### FYI: In folder `JSON-main/json/` you will find a README.md file enumerating the JSON functionality.

Have Fun!
