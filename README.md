JSON Library Implementation in C

by Jerry McIntosh

---

## TO START

---

This repository is written for a Linux OS.  FYI, the JSON Library was created on an OpenSuse Linux distro.  I do all my development on OpenSuse.  To get started you will need to run the following command at the command line while in the `JSON-main` folder:

sh ./json_make.sh

Should all end well then go to the folder `demo` to run the test script `go_demo.sh`.
